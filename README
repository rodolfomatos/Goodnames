About
=====

Goodnames is a Free and Open Source module for Moodle 2.x that provides
a way to teachers know if the students had submitted a file with certain
criteria. It is very usefull when a teacher has a large class divided
into groups, and each group has to submit a particular filename.
Often several members of the same group submit the same/similar files.
